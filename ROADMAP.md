# Arrakis Engine Roadmap

*Updated 2026-08-09 — current release v1.28.1*

This is the public-facing roadmap. The full release history is in
[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md); architectural details are in
[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

---

## What's shipped

### Core platform (v1.0.0, 2026-04-06)
First public open-source release under AGPL-3.0. 8 LLM providers, 16 pattern
visualizations, full pipeline (harvest → analyze → patterns → coach), settings UI,
240 tests.

### Coaching depth (v1.3.0, 2026-04-26)
Configurable coaching history injection (default 5, range 1–20) so the coach
adapts depth based on the player's history. Per-game token cost documented per
provider.

### Self-Analysis on the Patterns page (v1.4.0, 2026-04-26)
- **Fix Your Openings** — losses by opening, paired with strengths, split by
  White/Black with study links
- **Trap Patterns** — recognizes ~100 well-known named opening traps (Stafford,
  Fried Liver, Englund, Halloween, Cochrane, Wayward Queen Attack, Latvian,
  Damiano, Traxler, etc.) using the Lichess CC0 chess-openings dataset.
  "Your Arsenal" (winning traps) and "You Fall For" (losing traps) panels.
- **Trap row click-to-expand (v1.4.3)** — mini chess board with step-through
  controls, links to your actual games, and "Study on Lichess" deep links.

### Hunter Mode — opponent prep (v1.4.1+)
- **Backend (v1.4.1)** — fetch an opponent's recent public games from chess.com
  or lichess (no Stockfish, kept fast). REST API at `/api/hunt/profile`.
- **UI (v1.4.2)** — `/[player]/hunt` page with opponent search and Their
  Weaknesses / Their Strengths layout.
- **Click-to-expand opening rows (v1.4.4)** — mini-board, "Game N of 5" flip
  controls, annotated move list with deviation from book theory highlighted in
  orange.
- **Local accumulating PGN cache (v1.4.4)** — opponent games persist locally
  across refreshes; sliding window default 6 months; optional hard cap.

### Single-command serve (v1.5.0, 2026-04-26)
- **`python main.py serve`** — one command launches both backend (port 8000)
  AND Next.js frontend (port 3000) together. Spawns `pnpm dev` in its own
  process group, waits for the Next.js ready line, prints a unified banner
  with both URLs, and Ctrl+C stops both servers cleanly (SIGTERM → 5s grace
  → SIGKILL on the whole process group).
- Frontend stdout is line-prefixed with `[frontend]` so compile errors stay
  legible inline.
- Existing `dashboard` command kept (API-only mode for custom frontends,
  debugging, scripted pipelines), now with a hint pointing at `serve`.
- Optional flags: `--port`, `--frontend-port`, `--install`.
- New `src/dev_runner.py` module + 30 tests covering the orchestration.

### Frontend test infrastructure (v1.6.0, 2026-05-18)
- **Vitest harness** — jsdom + Testing Library + `@testing-library/jest-dom`
  matchers wired into the `frontend/` workspace. **66 frontend tests
  across 7 files**, sub-second full run.
- **Chess helper sweep** — `parseMoveText`, `lichessAnalysisUrl`, and the
  opening-matching helpers (`normalizeOpeningName`, `findCanonicalLine`,
  `findDeviationIndex`, `LibraryOpening`) extracted from three components
  into `frontend/lib/chess/`. Three component callers (`targeted-prep`,
  `opening-explorer`, `you-fall-for`) now import from the shared module.
- **v1.4.5 regression locks** at three layers:
  - Helper-level: `lichess.test.ts` asserts the
    `/analysis/standard/{FEN}` URL form and forbids the `?pgn=` form.
  - Hook-level: `use-chess-navigation.test.ts` asserts chess.com
    `{[%clk ...]}` annotations never leak into the moves array.
  - Component-level: all three component tests assert the same Lichess
    URL form on the actual rendered `<a>`.
- **CI gate** — `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `pnpm test:run` between
  install and build in the frontend job so regressions fail fast.

### Coaching depth & the Journal (v1.7.0–v1.13.3, 2026-05-18 → 05-27)
- **v1.7.x** — flagship cloud model defaults bumped; **ACPL capping at ±1000cp**
  + the mate-transition fix (a checkmating `Qxf7#` no longer scores as a ~2000cp
  loss), with the per-move loss formula centralized in one helper.
- **v1.8.0** — **trajectory-aware coaching**: the player's measured 30-day trend
  is injected into each game's prompt so advice reflects where they're heading.
- **v1.9.0** — **Recent Form Review**: an LLM narrative across the last N coached
  games.
- **v1.10.0–v1.12.0** — the **Journal**: a chronological coaching diary as its
  own tab, a threaded social-feed timeline, plus manual **Parent Notes**.
- **v1.13.0–v1.13.3** — coaching "Feedback to the Player" reads phase-by-phase;
  the dashboard consolidated to **API-only** (the static `export_json` +
  single-file HTML dashboard were removed).

### Tactical motifs & the slug system (v1.14.0–v1.17.0, 2026-05-28 → 05-29)
- **v1.14.0 + v1.17.0** — **tactical-motif detection**: 12 pure-Python detectors
  tag each critical move with the themes it executes or misses (fork, pin,
  skewer, discovered check, mate threat, removing the defender, hanging &
  trapped piece, back-rank mate, deflection, overloaded defender, zugzwang).
  Backfillable via `rescan-motifs` (no Stockfish).
- **v1.15.0–v1.16.0** — cross-game **motif aggregation** with a per-phase
  (opening/middlegame/endgame) breakdown → the **Tactical Themes** patterns card.
- **v1.16.1–v1.16.4** — the **slug system**: `username` (chess.com API only) /
  `slug` (URLs, API, CLI) / `display_name` (labels) decoupled; lookups became
  slug-only.

### Library, mobile & pattern depth (v1.18.0–v1.19.0, 2026-05-29)
- **v1.18.0** — expanded the Lichess trap/gambit/attack library **102 → 1,475
  entries**.
- **v1.18.2** — mobile-responsive (viewport meta tag).
- **v1.18.3** — Rating Progression chart on a proper **time-scale axis** with
  brush zoom.
- **v1.19.0** — **recurring weakness escalation**: distinct-game spread + recency
  streak classify each missed motif into watch/focus/priority tiers, leading the
  coaching prompt and filing a one-time "Priority Weakness" Journal alert.

### Opponent & tournament prep (v1.20.0–v1.21.0, 2026-05-29 → 05-30)
- **v1.20.0** — **Hunter Mode Deep Scan**: opt-in Stockfish + 12-motif analysis
  of an opponent's recent games surfaces the tactical themes they *miss*.
- **v1.21.0** — **Tournament Prep**: saved, named opponent rosters with a
  combined cross-opponent analysis + a field-wide blind-spots panel.

### Stability (v1.22.0–v1.22.5, 2026-05-30 → 06-05)
- **v1.22.0** — extensible nav bar. **v1.22.1–v1.22.5** — bug-fix batch: a
  status-poll server freeze, Run-All cancellation *between games*, the blitz
  report filter, and DB-lock hardening.

### PGN import & over-the-board games (v1.24.0–v1.26.3)
- **PGN import / export (v1.24.0)** — paste or upload a PGN; it joins the
  player's games and runs the normal analyze → coach pipeline. Export one or
  many games as raw or engine-annotated PGN.
- **Competition category (v1.25.0)** — an "Over-the-board / competition" import
  mode for games that exist only as a PGN (never on chess.com / lichess).
  Multi-game tournament files import at once; the game type you pick
  (Classical / Rapid / Blitz) sets the time class; color auto-detects from the
  player's name; games are tagged with a 🏆 Competition badge and filter.
- **Editable game metadata** — inline editors on the game detail page: player /
  opponent ratings (v1.25.1, OTB PGNs carry no Elo), and category + type + date
  (v1.26.2–v1.26.3, fixing the midnight-placeholder timing).
- **Privacy (v1.26.1)** — competition games never store the tournament name or
  venue: the PGN `Event`/`Site` headers are stripped on import (and on
  reclassify-to-competition), so they can't leak via the API or PGN export.
- **Three FIDE ratings (v1.26.0)** — Classical / Rapid / Blitz per player,
  editable on the Settings form. FIDE ratings are FIDE-specific and no longer
  override the chess.com / lichess rating.

### Coaching models & reliability (v1.27.0–v1.27.5)
- **Flagship model refresh + configurable reasoning effort (v1.27.0)** — all
  eight providers bumped to their current flagship reasoning models, plus a new
  `coaching.reasoning_effort` setting (low / medium / high / xhigh / max) wired
  into Claude (`output_config.effort`), ChatGPT (`reasoning.effort`), and Mistral
  (`reasoning_effort`, capped at high); other providers reason by default. A
  Reasoning-effort dropdown was added to Settings → Coaching.
- **Stuck-pipeline fix (v1.27.1)** — a dead process could leave the
  `pipeline_lock` row wedged in `running`, freezing the dashboard on "Working…";
  `get_state()` now reports a stale lock as idle.
- **Default effort → medium (v1.27.2)** and **Claude → Opus 5 (v1.27.3)**.
- **`~/.env` is authoritative (v1.27.4)** — `load_dotenv(override=True)` so the
  values in your `.env` win over any exported shell variables.
- **FIDE-format names import correctly (v1.27.5)** — an over-the-board scoresheet
  naming the player surname-first ("Leong, Xin Yu Evan" vs a display name of
  "Evan Leong") matched nothing and silently defaulted to White, inverting the
  result and recording the player as their own opponent. Names now match as bags
  of words, and an unmatched name **fails the import instead of guessing** a side.

### Pipeline reliability (v1.28.0, 2026-08-09)
- **Failed coaching now retries, and is visible.** A game whose coaching failed
  was stranded forever: the batch only ever looked at `pending` games, so
  `coach`, `run-all`, and the scheduler all skipped it, and nothing in the UI
  said so. Failures are now retried automatically up to 3 times (counted per
  game, reset on success), untried games keep priority over retries, and the
  Data Updates panel shows how many games failed — separating the ones that
  retry themselves from the ones needing a manual **Coach Game**. Pressing that
  button always restores a full retry budget, so the cap can't strand a game
  either.
- **`coach --player <slug>` no longer coaches everyone.** The filter resolved
  the identifier against the chess.com handle instead of the slug, matched
  nothing, and quietly fell through to every player's games.
- **Abandoned games are "no coaching needed", not failures (v1.28.1).** A game
  the opponent never moved in has no moves to coach, so it used to error — and
  then burn retry attempts on something unachievable. Those games now resolve
  as a **skipped** status: analysed, done, nothing to do, no LLM call, marked
  ➖ rather than ❌.

### Polish & bug fixes
- v1.0.1, v1.0.2 — UI fixes (opening explorer, dialog hydration)
- v1.3.1 — silenced client-disconnect log noise
- v1.3.2 — clearer two-server startup messaging
- v1.4.5 — Hunt Mode bug-fix batch (chess.com clock annotations broke move list,
  canonical-line lookup missed punctuation differences, autofill suppression on
  opponent input)

## Reasoning models requirement

Arrakis Engine requires **reasoning models** for coaching analysis. Chess coaching
demands multi-step reasoning: evaluating positions, understanding strategic themes,
connecting patterns across games, and generating age-appropriate explanations.
Non-reasoning models produce shallow, generic feedback.

### Supported providers

| Provider | Model | Type | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Anthropic | `claude-opus-5` | Cloud / Reasoning | Active |
| OpenAI | `gpt-5.6-sol` | Cloud / Reasoning | Active |
| Google | `gemini-3.5-flash` | Cloud / Reasoning | Active |
| xAI | `grok-4.5` | Cloud / Reasoning | Active |
| Mistral | `mistral-medium-latest` | Cloud / Reasoning | Active |
| DeepSeek | `deepseek-v4-pro` | Cloud / Reasoning | Active |
| Alibaba | `qwen3.7-max` | Cloud / Reasoning | Active |
| Ollama | `deepseek-r1:8b` | Local / Reasoning | Active |

All providers are available in the CLI (`--provider`), the dashboard pipeline
panel, per-game coaching buttons, and the Settings page. Adding a new provider
is a registration in `src/llm_providers.py` plus a metadata entry in
`frontend/lib/providers.ts`.

### Why non-reasoning models don't work

Models without chain-of-thought (standard chat models, small instruction-tuned
models) fail at chess coaching because they:

- Miss tactical sequences requiring look-ahead
- Generate generic advice not grounded in the actual position
- Cannot maintain coherent analysis across 30+ move games
- Produce inconsistent JSON structure

This is a strong project convention, not a code-level gate: `resolve_model` and
`call_provider` accept any model string, so the requirement is enforced by the
curated provider defaults and this guidance rather than by a runtime allowlist.

---

## Ollama / local models

Ollama is fully integrated as a local provider. It uses the OpenAI-compatible
API endpoint at `http://localhost:11434/v1` with no API key required.

**Default model:** `deepseek-r1:8b` (lightweight, ~5 GB RAM, good for testing)

### Recommended local models

| Model | Size | RAM | Quality | Speed (M3 Max) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `deepseek-r1:8b` | 8B | ~5 GB | Good for testing | ~30 tok/s |
| `deepseek-r1:14b` | 14B | ~9 GB | Moderate coaching | ~20 tok/s |
| `deepseek-r1:32b` | 32B | ~20 GB | Strong coaching | ~15 tok/s |
| `qwen3:8b` | 8B | ~5 GB | Good JSON reliability | ~30 tok/s |

### Local-model caveats

- **Quality gap**: Open-source reasoning models may not match frontier model depth,
  especially for nuanced coaching tone adjustments
- **Speed**: ~60-90 s per game coaching with 32B models on M3 Max
- **Memory**: 32B models need ~20 GB RAM
- **JSON reliability**: Smaller models may need retry logic for structured output
- **Coaching history depth**: With Ollama 8B, keep `coaching_history_count: 5`
  (default) — higher values may overflow the context window

## Where things are headed

### Near-term polish

Every release in the v1.4.x line has been bug-fix-driven. The rhythm is:
ship a feature → use it for a few hours → batch the bugs → ship a `.x` with
the fixes. Expect more of this on Hunter Mode + Self-Analysis as they get
real-world miles.

### Coaching depth experiments

- **Coaching feedback loop** — let the user mark a brief as "useful" / "not
  useful" per game; feed that signal into prompt selection or future tone.
- **Per-player tone preferences** — different siblings have different
  communication styles; let coaching tone be set per player, not per session.
- ~~**Recurring weakness escalation** — when a pattern persists across N games,
  surface it more prominently rather than repeating the same advice.~~
  **Shipped v1.19.0.** Distinct-game spread + recency streak classify each
  missed motif into watch/focus/priority tiers; escalated weaknesses lead the
  coaching prompts (with a prescribed drill, not a restated diagnosis), show a
  badge on the Tactical Themes card, and file a one-time "Priority Weakness"
  Journal alert.

### Pattern depth

- **Time-series view** of any pattern — generalize the trend pattern from ACPL
  + rating progression to all 20 metrics.
- **Position-type tagging** — classify positions by structural feature
  (isolated pawn, opposite-side castling) so coaching can reference them.
- **Opening prep mode** — instead of just analyzing what was played, suggest
  what to study next based on opening repertoire gaps.

### Hunter Mode extensions

- ✅ **Deep Scan — opponent tactical blind spots (shipped v1.20.0).** Opt-in
  Stockfish + 12-motif analysis of an opponent's last N games surfaces the
  tactical themes they MISS as a "Tactical Blind Spots" card (themes to bait
  them into). Background job, incremental, cached. CLI: `python main.py
  hunt-scan --opponent X`.
- **Trap detection on opponent games** — apply the v1.4.0 trap library to the
  opponent's accumulated games, surface "their favourite trap to play" /
  "their favourite trap to fall for".
- ✅ **Tournament prep mode (shipped v1.21.0).** Saved, named opponent rosters
  with a combined cross-opponent analysis — opening targets ("the field loses
  to the Italian") / cautions ("avoid the Najdorf") + a field-wide tactical
  blind-spots panel that aggregates over Deep-Scanned opponents. New Tournament
  tab + a Hunt "Add to tournament" bridge. CLI: `python main.py tournament-prep`.

### Frontend polish

- **Mobile** — core pages are mobile-ready as of v1.18.2 (viewport meta tag
  added; breakpoints fire at 1:1 scale). Dense chart grids (Patterns,
  Hunter Mode) still squeeze on narrow screens and would benefit from a
  dedicated mobile-layout pass — single-column stacking, larger tap targets.
- **Onboarding** — currently a chess parent has to know to add a player, set
  up an API key, and run the pipeline. A guided first-run flow would help.

### Coach-facing surfaces (longer-term)

- **Coach view** — UI optimized for the coach (technical, batch view across
  students)
- **Shareable game review links** — read-only public link for a coach to
  review a kid's game without their own instance

---

## Things explicitly NOT planned

- **Cloud / SaaS hosted version** — Arrakis is intentionally local. Privacy
  for kids' game data is the whole point.
- **Built-in puzzle trainer** — Lichess and chess.com already do this well.
- **Live game integration** — analysis is post-hoc by design.
- **Native mobile app** — responsive web is sufficient.

## Contributing

PRs welcome. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for setup and the test
contract. The pattern computation pipeline (`src/patterns.py`) is the easiest
place to add a new metric — see "Where to look when…" in
[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).
